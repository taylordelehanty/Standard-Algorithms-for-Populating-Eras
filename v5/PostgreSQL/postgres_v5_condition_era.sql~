---In Chris's original condition_era code, condition_occurrence_id is not in this table, but when at SAFTINet we ran through our data, we found that our condition_occurrence_count was not matching the count of all of the condition_occurrences in the condition_occurrence table. So to solve that and keep the records of the same person_id, condition_concept_id, and start_date from getting overlooked and put into one row, we grouped them by condition_occurrence_id as well to keep them from getting lumped together and overlooked.
---Chris DOES have this type of GROUP BY in his drug_era code
